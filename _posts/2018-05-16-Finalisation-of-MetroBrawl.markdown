### Items
There are now two items, a healing orb and a projectile. 

The project fires in the players direction dealing 20% damage and applying a force similar to play punches.
The health orb heals back 20%.

Both spawns periodically throughout the game session.

### Resolution

The footage above was recorded on a laptop with a 1366 x 768 resolution and looks the same as when played on 1920 x 1080!

### Gameplay
All the merges from previous game play aspects such as player_ui, punching and team select have been added. The player speed has been
increased to 800 rather than 100.

### Here what we have made so far
