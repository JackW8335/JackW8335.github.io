So far, we have picked are concept around the idea of espionage as it is a theme that is very important today. In the age of information 
and technology is as crucial as ever to control the flow of knowledge. So instead of going for just another war board game, we decided to use spies instead. The map used will be like the game risk and spies will be spread into different player factions. Resources and intel
will be the main source of income for players to get ahead of their rivals and it’s in everyone’s interest to take down a large 
organisation causing problems for the world. 

By having a goal players will have to inevitably turn on each other but can also help or hinder each other during the process.
So far, we are still deciding on how to implement intel and have multiple ideas such as looking at the next event card and having it be solved
via different intel cards. Or having intel foresee coming events by looking at the next event in a pack of cards. 

We also need to choose a map that allows for balanced play no matter the selection, although specialising dependent on location can be fun
it needs to fair otherwise certain player spawns will be at a disadvantage. As such are current objective is getting a working model so we
can play test and iterate the game as soon as possible.
