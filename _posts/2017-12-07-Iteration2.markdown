![The Final Almighty Board]({{ "/assets/img/blog/board.png" | absolute_url }})

We made a few crisis cards using this layout
![CRISIS]({{ "/assets/img/blog/crisisCard.png" | absolute_url }})

We made each one cause three areas to turn into a third of the total cost which is around 15, as mentioned in the earlier post iteration1 
there are three different prices used for difficulty and rewards scaling. The main difference between normal cases is that this requires
currency which is a resource gathered from solving cases. When solved crisis's lead towards the victory condition, which is provided by..

The boss card. We have designed a basic layout and called the first and only boss right now, the puppet master. He will require 1-2 crisis's
to be solved ( we haven't really decided, think 1 because the game lasts to long otherwise).

We tried making our own resource tokens but the paper wouldn't double side print and when we laminated to pieces placed back to back they split
upon cutting them apart to get the individual tokens. We are going to go back to using basic dish counters and player tokens. Heres the 
designs for refrence though:

We made some folders with the spare pages :D.
