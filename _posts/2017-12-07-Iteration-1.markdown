We have updated the board with new textures and moved some of the resources to different tiles. We also decided during the process to make 
spies cap at 3 as while there are 21 area's on our map there are only 5 regions. This means you can have a spy on 3/5 area's. Anymore would 
one crowd the map and two reduce the chance of the case spawning else where to zero.

Speaking of cases we also printed of some basic case cards, each one with a cost for munitions, production and science. We have tried to 
scale the costs around 5,10 and 15 for difficulty these grant different tiers of rewards of which are currency. Currency is used to 
purchase more spies and solve crisis's which are need to win the game.

We updated the symbols from the basic star, square and triangle to binoculars, a briefcase and a stopwatch. This is mostly for theme reasons
the gameplay aspect of receiving a new bonus each turn remanis the same.

We stopped one spy from being to powerful by making it unusable during a case. This adds more incentive to purchasing other spies to solve
cases simultaneously. This is works with the tracking system which involves placing your spy token on the case card till it is discarded
at the end of a phase (6 turns). We added this to keep track of who solved what case. Removing this would require us to replace that system.

The tech tree orignally mentioned to add different playstyles has been dropped as it would add too many moving parts to a game that should
be simple, atleast with the time constraints provided. So far focusing on the key aspects of the game e.g. movement, economy , player interaction,
the final boss etc Has taken priority.

Intelligence has become the resources mentioned above, munitions, production and science. These are used the solve the cases of which have
there costs written on the card. However the ability to see whats coming has still remained. Every phase someone draws five cards and 
everyone looks at one of the five, shuffles and passes it along until every player has one target. This is one of the engaging aspects of
our game as no one knows if they have the same information as the others. This creates suspence and fits the theme well as information is
free flowing and no one knows what others know.
