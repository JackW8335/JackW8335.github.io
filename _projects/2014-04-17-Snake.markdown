#### Snake PostMortem
This version of snake simply renders the sprite of a square followed by multiple sprites of the same type that move to the previous location before the update occured. Eating the red fruit(apple) causes the score and body size of the snake to increase. For power ups the cold fruit slows the player down and the opposite occurs with the fire fruit, causing increasing speed. 

This project was before I gathered the use of smart pointers and vectors, as such memory allocation was more difficult using standard pointers. When consuming fruit there is a slight memory leak as the player increases in size.



Here is the zip file for the project, just open it in Visual Studios 2017 and run the sln [snake-jackw8335-master.zip][1]
